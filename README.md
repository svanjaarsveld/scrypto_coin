# Scrypto Coin
This is my first blockchain and cryptocurrency. Both were developed in Python.
The work done here is based on the Blockchain A-Z course by Kirill Eremenko and Hadelin de Ponteves:

## Getting started
This project uses the following utilities:

Flask - A micro web framework written in Python (3.6)
```
pip install Flask==0.12.2
```
